    <div><p>Please read these terms of service (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”) carefully as this
        Agreement constitutes a binding contract between the user that accepts
        this Agreement (“<strong>Customer</strong>”) and penycount Accounting Inc., a Delaware
        company having its registered address at 692 GRANT CIRCLE HANOVER PARK, IL 60133 (“<strong>penycount</strong>”) governing your use of the
        services available through the penycount website at
        <a href="https://www.penycount.com/lp-2"><u>https://www.penycount.com/lp-2</u></a> (“<strong>Site</strong>”) and any mobile
        applications (each an “<strong>App</strong>”) through which they may be made
        available (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). By checking an opt-in box, clicking on
        “I accept” or otherwise accepting this Agreement on the sign-up page,
        installing the App, or otherwise accessing or using the Services,
        Customer acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be
        bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Customer is
        using the Services on behalf of an entity, partnership, or other
        organization, then Customer represents that they: (i) are an authorized
        representative of that entity with the authority to bind that entity to
        this Agreement and (ii) such entity agrees to be bound by this
        Agreement. If Customer does not agree to the terms of this Agreement,
        then they are not permitted to use the Services.</p>
        <p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE</strong>. Except for certain kinds of disputes described
        in the Arbitration provision below, Customer agrees that disputes
        arising under this Agreement will be resolved by binding individual
        arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AND penycount ARE
        EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS
        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. CUSTOMER AGREES TO GIVE UP CUSTOMER
        RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend Customer rights under this
        contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).
        Your rights will be determined by a single ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or
        jury. See the Arbitration provision below.</p>
        <p><strong>BANKING SERVICES</strong>: penycount is not a bank and does not itself provide
        any banking services. The penycount Services are, however, integrated with
        certain third party servicers, that we call Third Party Servicers.
        Radius Bank, Member FDIC (“<strong>Radius</strong>”) is a Third Party Servicer. By
        applying to open a deposit account through the Services, Customer also
        hereby agrees to the following additional agreements between Customer
        and Radius (collectively, the “<strong>Radius Agreement</strong>”):</p>
        <p>penycount recommends that you print a copy of this Agreement and the Radius
        Agreement for your records. If not defined in the body of this
        Agreement, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the
        glossary at the end of this Agreement.</p>
        <h3>1.  <strong>Services.</strong></h3>
        <p>The Services consist of cloud-based financial tools and services which
        may include (i) bookkeeping, accounting and access to banking services,
        (ii) financial information storage and reporting, (iii) tax preparation
        and advisory services (“<strong>Tax Services</strong>”), and (iv) the service of
        communicating information to, from and among Third Party Servicers, as
        per Customer instructions. Customer may make certain selections of
        Services that they wish to procure through the Application or the
        Account.</p>
        <p>penycount will provide the Services to Customer for the term of this
        Agreement, subject to the payment of applicable Fees and compliance with
        the terms of this Agreement. As part of the Services, penycount hereby
        grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable
        right to use the Services, as per the terms of this Agreement. Customer
        acknowledges that the Services are cloud-based and hosted services and
        no copies of the Services or penycount System will be delivered to Customer,
        other than (where available) the App, subject to the End User License
        Agreement (“EULA”). The Services shall be used by Customer solely for
        Customer own purposes and penycount does not convey any right, title or
        interest in the Services or penycount System to Customer. Customer right to
        use the Services shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement
        or any suspension or termination of the supply of the Services to
        Customer.</p>
        <p><em>Financial Transactions</em></p>
        <p>penycount shall not perform any financial transactions for Customer.
        Customer may, however, use the Services to communicate Customer
        instructions to a Third Party Servicer of Customer which Third Party
        Servicer may perform a financial transaction on behalf of Customer
        pursuant to the Third Party Servicer Agreement. For example, if Customer
        opens a bank account with Radius, then a data Transaction through the
        Services may result in a financial transaction within the Customer
        account with Radius pursuant to the Radius Agreement. penycount is not
        liable for any such financial transaction or the results thereof.</p>
        <p><em>Errors</em></p>
        <p>Customer shall immediately notify penycount of any errors by penycount or
        Customer in the supply or use of the Services. Where practicable, penycount
        shall use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate errors, but
        makes no representation as to its ability to correct the error. Customer
        shall provide penycount with any information necessary to investigate an
        error in a Transaction. Some payment transactions, such as wire
        transfers, are irreversible, so Customer agrees to exercise extreme
        caution when initiating any financial transaction by way of instructions
        delivered one of its Third Party Servicers through the Services.</p>
        <p><em>Tax Services</em></p>
        <p>Customer acknowledges that penycount will provide Tax Services only if and
        upon Customer’s completion of a validly executed Taxpayer
        Disclosure Authorization in which Customer consents to allow penycount to
        disclose certain tax information as specifically described therein for
        such period until Customer is no longer using penycount’s tax return
        preparation services. Customer understands and acknowledges that penycount
        will not provide Tax Services until such Taxpayer Disclosure
        Authorization is executed and provided to penycount.</p>
        <h3>2.  <strong>penycount Account and Customer ID.</strong></h3>
        <p>penycount shall provide Customer with a unique and private Account
        accessible through the Service. The Account shall be a record of
        Customer Transactions and Fees. penycount shall provide Customer with access
        codes for the Account. Customer shall not disclose such codes or permit
        any third party to use them. Customer has exclusive responsibility for
        the use of Customer Account. penycount will invite Customer to enter certain
        preferences and specifications within the Application or the Account
        that will apply to the Services; Customer assumes exclusive
        responsibility for such selections even if they contain errors by
        Customer or result in losses to Customer. Any additional terms and
        conditions posted to the Site with respect to the Account or specific
        Services preferences selected by Customer are incorporated herein by
        reference.</p>
        <p>Except as required to deliver the Services or as otherwise required by
        law, penycount shall not grant any third party access to Customer Account.</p>
        <p>Customer shall notify penycount by email to
        <a href="mailto:sales@penycount.com"><u>sales@penycount.com</u></a> immediately of any loss or
        disclosure, whether voluntary or otherwise, of any Account password or
        access code to a third party.</p>
        <p>Upon Customer’s request, penycount will also issue Customer a Customer ID
        associated with the Account (“<strong>Customer ID</strong>”). Customer may share
        their Customer ID only with officers, directors, bookkeepers,
        accountants or other Customer personnel that are directly employed or
        engaged by Customer (“<strong>Customer Personnel</strong>”) provided that Customer
        binds such third parties to undertakings of confidentiality and to also
        honor the terms hereof. Customer Personnel may only access and use the
        Services through the Customer ID and in compliance with this Agreement;
        Customer will not allow Customer Personnel to share the Customer ID with
        third parties. Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under
        its Customer ID whether by Customer Personnel or otherwise. penycount
        reserves the right to replace the Customer ID in its sole discretion for
        any reason or for no reason. Any Customer Personnel who accesses the
        Services does so subject to this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Customer shall provide, at Customer’s own expense, all necessary
        hardware, applications and internet connectivity necessary to access the
        Services. Customer acknowledges that the internet can be unpredictable
        in performance, unsecure and may, from time to time, impede access to
        the Services or performance hereunder. Customer agrees that penycount is not
        responsible for any internet outages, unsecure WIFI or other connections
        or any other interference with Customer’s use of or access to the
        Services or security breaches arising from any Customer Device and
        Customer waives any and all claims against penycount in connection
        therewith.</p>

        card, debit card or other means of payment; Customer authorizes penycount to

        funds or credit available to cover Customer’s purchase.</p>

        the handling of these transactions. This authority is to remain in
        effect until penycount receives written notice from Customer revoking it.

        Routing Number and Account Number of the Customer Bank Account is
        incorrect, and funds are incorrectly deposited, penycount will attempt to
        assist Customer in the recovery of such funds but has no liability as to
        restitution of the same. penycount’s assistance in recovering the funds,
        where available, will be billed to Customer at penycount’s current hourly

        refund of any pre-paid, but unused Fees related to such Services,
